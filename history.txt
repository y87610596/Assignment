-I used to rule the world
-Seas would rise when I gave the word
-Now in the morning, I sleep alone
-Sweep the streets I used to own
-I used to roll the dice
-Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
-Listen as the crowd would sing
-Now the old king is dead, long live the king
-One minute, I held the key
-Next the walls were closed on me
-And I discovered that my castles stand
-Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
-I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
-Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
-Be my mirror, my sword and shield
-My missionaries in a foreign field
-For some reason, I can't explain
-Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word
-And that was when I ruled the world
-It was the wicked and wild wind
-Blew down the doors to let me in
-Shattered windows and the sound of drums
-People couldn't believe what I'd become
-Revolutionaries wait
-For my head on a silver plate
-Just a puppet on a lonely string
-Oh, who would ever want to be king?
-I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing
-Roman Calvary choirs are singing
-Be my mirror, my sword and shield
-My missionaries in a foreign field
-For some reason, I can't explain
